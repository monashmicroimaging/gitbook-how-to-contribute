## Instructions for training material contributors/editors

* Download git from: https://git-scm.com/downloads
* Install git using the install wizard.

### 2. Setup a GitHub account
* Create a free GitHub account at: https://github.com/join?source=header-home
* Ask one of the MMI Image Analysts to add you to the Monash Micro Imaging GitHub group: https://github.com/monashmicroimaging
    Email us and tell us your GitHub username so we can add you as a member.

### 3. Install the GiHub desktop app
* Download the GitHub desktop app for your operating system at: https://desktop.github.com/

* Note: The default path will be: ~\\Documents\\GitHub\\

### 4. Install the GitBook editor
* Download the GitBook editor at: https://www.gitbook.com/editor
* Install the Gitbook editor using the install wizard.
(Optional: You don't have to make an account on the GitBook website. The Gitbook editor will prompt you to sign up or login every time you open the editor, but you can just click 'No thanks' or 'Remind me later'.)
* Change the GitBook library path.
*(This step is so you get a nice list of all your Gitbooks when you open the Gitbook Editor.)*
  1. Create two sub-directories (folders) inside your GitHub folder.

    *You can make the new folders with Windows Explorer/Finder/Dolphin (Windows/Mac/Linux) or however you usually like to create folders.*
    * The first folder is called "Gitbook_library" and goes inside the folder named "GitHub", eg: ~\\Documents\\GitHub\\Gitbook_library\\
    * The second folder is called "Gitbooks" and goes inside the folder named "Gitbook_library", eg: ~\\Documents\\GitHub\\Gitbook_library\\Gitbooks\\

  1. Change the library path of the Gitbook Editor
    * Open the GitBook editor you just installed.
    * Click the GitBook editor menu, then click "Change Library Path..."
    * Set the Gitbook editor path to: ~\\Documents\\GitHub\\Gitbook_library\\

Done! You have everything installed now that you'll need to contribute to our Gitbooks.

## Get the Gitbooks (cloning from GitHub.com)
  * Go to the Monash Micro Imaging github page: https://github.com/monashmicroimaging
  * Find the Gitbook you want in the list of repositories, and click to open it (eg: gitbook-fiji-training).
  * Now click the green "Clone or download" button on the right hand side, then click "Open in Desktop".

## Contributing to a GitBook
Open the Gitbook editor software, and click on the name of the particular Gitbook you want to edit.

*If you can't see the name of the Gitbook you want when you open the GitBook editor, check you have cloned it from GitHub.com. Then check if the repository is in the right place on your computer, i.e. ~\\Documents\\GitHub\\Gitbook_library\\Gitbooks\\repository-name\\ .*

### 1. Check for any changes made by other people
This is important to do whenever you open a Gitbook for editing. 
In the Gitbook editor, go to the "Book" menu, and click "Pull". 
This looks for any changes shared on the GitHub.com repository, then pulls those changes to your computer so your copy is up to date.

### 2. Add your content
The contents of Gitbooks (text, images, tables, etc) use Markdown formatting. You can change the formatting using the options in the "Markup" menu. Here's an easy guide to using Markdown, if you'd like to know more: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

ou can add new articles to the book by clicking the "Add an article" button in the left hand side menu. Alternatively, you can go to the Gitbook Editor menu and click "New Article".

You can organise articles into sections by right-clicking in the left hand side menu and selecting "Add part". For more information:

* https://toolchain.gitbook.com/structure.html

### 3. Sync your changes
lick the blue button at the top right hand corner of the Gitbook editor to **save** your changes. The button will change to a more transparent shade of blue, and a second "Publish and Sync" blue button will appear in the top right hand corner. Click the publish and sync button

### 4. Get the book built
Currently, a MMI staff member will need to build the html book before edits can be displayed online. Please email to request this if your changes have been significant. In the future, we plan to use a continuous integration service to build automatically following changes, so the online book will be up to date at all times.
